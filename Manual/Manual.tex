\section{Modeling}
\label{sec:modeling}
 Models are described using an internal modeling language, based on the XML syntax~\cite{XML}, called \emph{PMF} (Parsybone model file). The model is provided within a single PMF file that holds specification of the regulatory network. 
 
For description of desired properties of the dynamical system a second file type, also based on the XML, is used. Predictably the name of the format is PPF (Parsybone property file).

Both the files must abide by the general XML rules and be provided as runtime arguments with their suffixes corresponding to their data type, i.e. with the \emph{.pmf} and \emph{.ppf} suffixes.

\subsection{Model example}
Every model must be enclosed within a pair \texttt{NETWORK} tag. A detailed description of the modeling language is provided later in this section, here we present, as an example, a model file for the network depicted in the \emph{introductory pdf}. 

This example model has a quite non-uniform syntax, which has been chosen on purpose to present different possibilities of model description.
\begin{alltt}
<NETWORK>
    <SPECIE undef="basal" name="cA">
        <REGUL source="B" threshold ="1" label="Observable" />
        <REGUL source="cA" />            
    </SPECIE>
    <SPECIE>
        <REGUL source="cA" />
        <REGUL source="B" label="+" />            
        <PARAM context="" value="?" />
        <PARAM context="B" value="1" />
        <PARAM context="cA,B" value="0,1" />          
    </SPECIE>
</NETWORK>
\end{alltt}
As can be seen, the model is a structure with two species, both being affected by two regulations. For the component $B$, the possible parametrizations space is reduced by requirements that the regulation from $cA$ must be observable and that the effect of its self-regulation must be positive, if any. Also, the logical parameter of self-regulation of the component $B$ must always be 1. As a result, the parametrization space is reduced to four possibilities.

\subsection{Model property}
The main purpose of the tool is picking parametrizations that satisfy some property. The description of this property can be given in one of two possible ways - either as B\"uchi automaton or as a time series. A time series is merely a B\"uchi automaton specialization, but as will be explained later the Parsybone is optimized for its usage and provides additional features if the time series is employed. To demonstrate the difference between the two, we present a single property described using each formalism. 

This property assures that the model depicted in the complementary \emph{introductory pdf} is able to reproduce a time series composed of the following three measurements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $cA=0 \wedge (B=0 \vee B=1)$
\item $cA \Leftrightarrow B$
\item $cA=1 \wedge B=0$
\end{enumerate}
Only two out of four parametrizations allow for reproduction of this time series. To obtain them, we can describe the time series either using the B\"uchi automaton:
\begin{alltt}
<AUTOMATON>
    <STATE final="0">
        <EDGE target="0" label="tt" />
        <EDGE target="1" label="cA=0" /> 
    </STATE>
    <STATE>
        <EDGE target="1" label="tt" />
        <EDGE target="last" label="((cA=0 &amp; B=0) | (cA=1 &amp; B=1))" /> 
    </STATE>
    <STATE name="last">
        <EDGE target="last" label="tt" />
        <EDGE target="3" label="(cA=1 &amp; B=0)" /> 
    </STATE>
    <STATE final="1">
        <EDGE target="3" label="tt" />
    </STATE>
</AUTOMATON>
\end{alltt}
Or using the time series directly:
\begin{alltt}
<SERIES>
    <EXPR values="cA=0" />
    <EXPR values="((cA=0 &amp; B=0) | (cA=1 &amp; B=1))" />		
    <EXPR values="(cA=1 &amp; B=0)" />
</SERIES>
\end{alltt}
As can be seen, the second method makes the model quite shorter and should be used for description of time series.

		\end{menum}
	\end{mitem}
\end{mitem}	

\subsection{Edge label}
\label{EdgeLabel}
There are two basic labels:
\begin{itemize}
\item [+]	Meaning that the there must be a regulation whose parameter value increases if we add this regulator.
\item [-]	Has the opposite meaning.
\end{itemize}
One can compose these labels using a logical formula over $+$ and $-$ or use one of the following predefined descriptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Activating: $+$
\item ActivatingOnly: $(+ \wedge \neg -)$
\item Inhibiting: $-$
\item InhibitingOnly: $(- \wedge \neg +)$
\item NotActivating: $\neg +$
\item NotInhibiting: $\neg -$
\item Observable: $(+ \vee -)$
\item NotObservable: $(\neg + \wedge \neg -)$
\item Free: $true$

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Static constraints}
\label{StaticConstraints}
Constraints that globally restrict the parametrization space based on certain assumptions.
\subsubsection{bound\_loop}
This constraint serves purely to optimization of multi-valued models and should be always used, unless there is a reason not to.

In multi-valued models, a scenario where multiple different parameters spawn the same structure may occur, simply because the values lay outside the activity levels for the respective context. This constraint leaves only a single representative of this behavior.

\subsubsection{force\_extremes}
This constraint simply assigns an exact target value in two cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item $0$ is assigned for the case when all positive regulators are absent and all negative are present.
 \item $max$ is assigned for the case when all negative regulators are absent and all positive are present.
\end{itemize}
For this property, an unambiguous edge constraint must be assigned - Observable, NotObservable and Free edge constraints will cause the force\_extremes switch to have not effect for the regulated component.

\subsection{Formula construction}
\label{FormulaConstruction}
A formula is constructed using the following set of recursive rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $tt$ and $ff$ are formulas representing true or false respectively,
\item any atomic proposition is a formula,
\item for every formula $A$ is $\neg A$ a formula,
\item for formulas $A,B$ are $(A|B)$ and $(A\&B)$ formulas representing logical disjunction and conjunction respectively,
\item nothing else is a formula.
\end{enumerate}
Note that in the model $\neg$ is denoted using \texttt{!} and for compliance with XML, $\&$ is denoted using \texttt{\&amp;}.

\subsection{Atomic propositions}
\label{AtomicPropositions}
An atomic proposition is a string of the form: $specie*value$, where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $specie$ denotes the name or ordinal number of a specie,
\item $*$ denotes comparison operator from the set $\{<,>,=\}$,
\item $value$ denotes a positive integer with which the value of the specie is compared.
\end{itemize}
Note that in the model, for compliance with XML, $<$ is denoted using \texttt{\&lt;} and $>$ is denoted using \texttt{\&gt;}.
