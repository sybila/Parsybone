Parsybone (Parameter Synthetizer for Boolean Networks) project
Copyright (C) 2012 - Adam Streck
Systems Biology Laboratory of Masaryk University, Brno
open-source 2012, GNU GPL v3, uses RapidXML (see http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/ )

Requirements:
	GCC v4.5.x or Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
	Boost libraries v1.4.x
	
Building:
	Apart from the boost libraries there are no additional dependencies, so you can build that using a simple Makefile in the GCCProject directory or compile it anywhere you want.

Execution:
	Parsybone reads the model in a XML format from the standard stream, displays results on the standard output and errors on the standard error output.

Arguments:
	Parsybone [-cstvw] [-D process_ID number_of_processes] [-F results_file]
	-b add BA state to witness
	-c show permitted colors
	-s show satistics
	-t test against time serie (or another property that can be checked by Final Buchi automaton)
	-v use verbose output
	-w show only shortest witnesses
	-W show all witnesses
	-o show only one witness for each color
	-m #filename	Name of the file that holds bitmask for used colors
	-M #filename	Name of the file to ouput bitmask from this computation
	-D #num1 #num2	Used for distributed computation - process will compute only part of the parameter space as given in the second number, first number determines which part it is
	-F #fileneme	Name of the file that will store the results.
