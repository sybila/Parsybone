Parsybone (Parameter Synthetizer for Boolean Networks) project
by Adam Streck 
Systems Biology Laboratory of Masaryk University, Brno
open-source 2012, uses RapidXML (see http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/ )

Requirements:
	GCC v4.5.x or Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
	Boost libraries v1.4.x
	
Building:
	Apart from the boost libraries there are no additional dependencies, so you can build that using a simple Makefile in the GCCProject directory or compile it anywhere you want.

Execution:
	Parsybone reads the model in a XML format from the standard stream and displays results on the standard output.

Arguments:
	Parsybone [option] [-d process_ID number_of_processes] [-f results_file] 
	-d Used for distributed computation - process will compute only part of the parameter space as given in the second number, first number determines which part it is
	-f Name of the file that will store the results.
