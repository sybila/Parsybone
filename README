open-source 2012, GNU GPL v3, uses:
	Boost Libraries ( http://www.boost.org/ )
	RapidXML ( see http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/ )

For full manual, refer to Manual.pdf file. For documentation reference refer to Reference.pdf file.

Requirements:
	GCC v4.5.0 or Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler 10.0
	Boost libraries v1.4.4
	
Building:
	Apart from the boost libraries there are no additional dependencies. Using the g++ one should currently specify usage of C++11 (-std=c++0x parameter).

Execution:
	Parsybone model_file.dbm [-rsvwW] [-d process_ID number_of_processes] [-f results_file] [-m input_mask_file] [-M output_mask_file]

	model_file.dbm	name of the file that will be parsed and used, must have .dbm suffix
	
	-r	display robustness of a color
	-s	show satistics
	-v	use verbose output
	-w	show witnesses in with numbers of states
	-W 	show witnesses in with actuall values of states
	
	-d #num1 #num2	Used for distributed computation - process will compute only part of the parameter space as given in the second number, first number determines which part it is
	-f #fileneme	Name of the file that will store the results.
	-m #filename	Name of the file that holds bitmask for used colors
	-M #filename	Name of the file to ouput bitmask from this computation

Output:
	Data from the "verbose" stream are printed on lines starting with * 
	Data from the "statistics" stream are printed on lines starting with #
	Data from the "error" stream are printed on lines starting with !
	
	Results are printed without prefix in the form:
	acceptable_parametrization_number:actual_parametrization_values:[cost]:[robustness_value]:[{time_series_walks_transitions}]
